Simple markdown document storage.

## Usage

`xsu-docshare` is served through the `sproc` web UI. The included `xsu-docshare` binary is for managing user accounts through a CLI.

## vs. Registry Book

The registry book stores files on the file system and can only be updated using the server key. Docshare (DS) allows any user account to manage their own documents and store them in the database.
